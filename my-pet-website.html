    <h1>Pluto The Dog</h1>
    <h2>Brief Description</h2>
    <p>My favourite pet as you clearly know is called Pluto. He is a yellow-orange color, medium-sized, short-haired dog with black ears.</p>
    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pluto loves it when I get to pet him often</li>
        <li>He likes going on long adventurous walk and discovering new place</li>
        <li>I usually take him to the neighbourhood park for him to interact and play with other dogs</li>
        <li>Playing fetch with his little squeaky ball is definitely one of his favourite activities</li>
